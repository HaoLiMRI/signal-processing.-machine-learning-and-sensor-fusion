Algorithms introduced in the presentation for sensor fusion: Bayesian filter principle, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman, particle filter.

I plan to add rest of the presentation held for sharing the basic algorithm and models in SLAM

(In case anyone is interested in joining in, send email to chisyliu@hotmail.com)I also plan to add some demo codes to illustrate how KF, EKF, UKF and PF works in sensor fusion, especially with radar and lidar
