Algorithms introduced in the presentation for tracking filter: Bayesian filter principle, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman, particle filter for filtering

I plan to add more knowledge survey for sharing all other basic algorithms and models in target tracking(e.g. NNSF, PDAF, GSF(Gaussian Sum Filter) for data association in single point model based single-target tracking; GNN, JPDAF, MHT for data association in single point model based multi-target tracking; PHD, CPHD for extended multi-target tracking), and sensor fusion strategies

I also plan to add some demo codes to illustrate how KF, EKF, UKF and PF works in tracking filter

In case anyone is interested in joining in, send email to chisyliu@hotmail.com
